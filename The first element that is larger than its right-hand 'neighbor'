Write a function firstBigger that takes a numeric array arr as an argument and returns the first element of the array that is larger than its right-hand neighbor
or undefined if the array is in ascending order.

Examples:

firstBigger ([0, 8, 4, 1])  return 8 (since 8> 4 is the first element of the array that is greater than the next element);
firstBigger ([1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 15])  return undefined (since the elements are in ascending order the array does not contain an element that is greater than the next element);
firstBigger ([]) f return undefined.

Solution:

function firstBigger(arr){
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) return arr[i];
  }
}
