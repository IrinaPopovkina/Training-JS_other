The football team took part in several games of the football season.
The array stores information about the number of goals scored by each player in different games.

For example [[1, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 1], [2, 4], ..., [2, 1, 1]].
If a football player has not scored a single goal, then there is no information about his goals in the array, there is no element [0] in the array. 
It is required to determine the total number of goals scored by the football team during the season.

Write a function sumOfGoals that takes an array arr that stores the number of goals scored by each player in different games 
and returns the total number of goals scored by a soccer team.
Use a loop in your solution. Array methods are not allowed.

Example:
sumOfGoals ([[2, 2], [3, 2, 1], [4, 3, 3]]) should return 20.

Solution:

function sumOfGoals(arr){
  let sum = 0;
  for(let el of arr) {
    for(let i of el) {
      sum += i;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
