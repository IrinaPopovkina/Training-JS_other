Write a function called squareRoot that takes x as an argument and returns:

square root of x if x> = 0,
the message "Root of a negative number is NaN" if x <0.
Round the result to two decimal places.

Examples:

squareRoot (9) should return 3;
squareRoot (0) should return 0;
squareRoot (-4) should return "Root of a negative number is NaN".

Solution:

function squareRoot(x){
  return x >= 0 ? +Math.sqrt(x).toFixed(2) : "Root of a negative number is NaN";
}
