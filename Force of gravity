The force of gravity with which the Earth attracts a body on or near its surface is called gravity.
The force with which the Earth attracts bodies can be calculated by the formula F = mâ‹…g, where m is the mass of the body and g is the acceleration of gravity. 
Near the Earth's surface the value of g is approximately 9.81.

Write a function named forceOfGravity that takes m (body weight in kilograms) as an argument and returns gravity, rounded to the nearest integer.

Example:

forceOfGravity (10) should return 98.

Solution:


function forceOfGravity(m){
 return Math.round(9.81 * m);
}
