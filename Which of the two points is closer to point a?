Three points a, b, c with different coordinates lie on the number axis. Determine which of the two points: b or c is closer to point a.

Write a function named nearestPoint that takes three numbers a, b, c (coordinates of three points on the number axis) as arguments and returns:

string "b" if point b is closer to point a,
string "c", if point c is closer to point a,
string "distances are equal" if the distances from points b and c to point a are equal.

Examples:

nearestPoint (9, 6, 14) should return "b";
nearestPoint (3, 0, 4) should return "c";
nearestPoint (0, 2, -4) should return "b"

Solution:

function nearestPoint(a, b, c){
  return Math.abs(a - b) === Math.abs(a - c) ? "distances are equal" : Math.abs(a - b) > Math.abs(a - c) ? 'c' : 'b';
}
