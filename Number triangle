Write a function called numericalTriangle that takes n as an argument and returns a triangle of numbers 1 through n separated by a space. 
All lines except the last one end with a \ n newline character.

For example for n = , the line should be:

"1 \ n2 2 \ n3 3 3 \ n4 4 4 4 \ n5 5 5 5 5"

When outputting to the console such a line is displayed as a "triangle" of numbers:

Examples:

numericalTriangle (1) should return: "1";
numericalTriangle (3) should return: "1 \ n2 2 \ n3 3 3".

Solution:
