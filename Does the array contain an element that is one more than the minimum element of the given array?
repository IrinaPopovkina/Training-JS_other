Write a function includeGreaterThanMin that takes a non-empty arr array as an argument and returns true if the array contains an element that is one more than the minimum element
and false otherwise.

Example:

includeGreaterThanMin ([1, 3, 4, 5])return false since the minimum element is 1 and the array does not contain 2;
includeGreaterThanMin ([0, 1, 2, 3]) return true since the minimum element is 0 and the array contains 1;
includeGreaterThanMin ([9, -2, 10, -1, 8])return true since the minimum element is -2 and the array contains -1.

Solution:

function includeGreaterThanMin(arr){
  return arr.includes(Math.min(...arr) + 1);
}
