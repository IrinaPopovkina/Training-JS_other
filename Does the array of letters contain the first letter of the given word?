An array is given containing a number of letters of the alphabet. The word has been given.
Does the array contain the first letter of the given word?
Write a function includesFirstLetter that takes an array of letters arr and the word word as arguments
and returns true if the array contains the first letter of the given word and false otherwise.

Example:

includesFirstLetter (['a', 'b', 'c'], 'banana') must return true because the array contains b - the first letter of the word banana;
includesFirstLetter (['c', 'd', 'q', 'a'], 'cat') must return true because the array contains c - the first letter of the word cat;
includesFirstLetter (['f', 't', 'z'], 'apple') must return false since the array does not contain the letter a.

Solution:

function includesFirstLetter(arr, word){
  return arr.includes(word[0]);
}
