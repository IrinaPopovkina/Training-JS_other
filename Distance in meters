The given distance is length in centimeters. Find the number of full meters in this distance. (1 m = 100 cm).

Write a function named distanceInMeters that takes length (distance in centimeters) as an argument and returns the number of full meters in that distance. 
Use the Math.floor () method.

Examples:

distanceInMeters (4814) should return 48;
distanceInMeters (525) should return 5;
distanceInMeters (599) should return 5.

Solution:

function distanceInMeters(length){
  return Math.floor(length / 100);
}
