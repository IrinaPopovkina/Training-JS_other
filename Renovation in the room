The surface area of the walls in the room is s square meters. 
The wallpaper tube is 10 meters long and w meters wide. How many wallpaper tubes do you need to buy in order to renovate a room?

Write a function called numberOfWallpapers that takes the numbers s (wall surface area) and w (wallpaper tube width) as arguments 
and returns the number of wallpaper tubes needed to repair.

Examples:

numberOfWallpapers (58, 0.5) should return 12;
numberOfWallpapers (36, 1) should return 4.

Solution:

function numberOfWallpapers(s, w){
  return Math.ceil(s / (w * 10));
}
