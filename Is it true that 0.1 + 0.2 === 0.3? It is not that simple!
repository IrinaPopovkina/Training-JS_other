Write a function isSumEqualsNumber that takes three fractional numbers a, b, c as arguments and checks if the sum of the two fractional numbers equals the third fractional number 
i.e. is the sum of a and b equal to c.

The function must return true (if the sum of the numbers after rounding is equal to the third number) or false otherwise.

Example:

isSumEqualsNumber (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) function must return true.

Solution:

function isSumEqualsNumber(a, b, c){
  return (a + b).toFixed(2) === c.toFixed(2);
}
