The traveler covered the distance s1 km from point A to point B in t1 hours
then the distance s2 km from point B to point C in t2 hours. 
Find the average speed of the traveler and round the result to 2 decimal places.

Write a function averageSpeed that takes 4 numbers s1, t1, s2, t2 as arguments and returns the average speed of the traveler. 
Round the result to 2 decimal places and return it as a number.

Examples:

averageSpeed (14, 3, 6, 2) should return 4.
averageSpeed (5, 2, 10, 3) should return 3.
averageSpeed (17, 5, 20, 4) should return 4.11.

Solution:

function averageSpeed(s1, t1, s2, t2){
  return +((s1 + s2) / (t1 + t2)).toFixed(2);
}
