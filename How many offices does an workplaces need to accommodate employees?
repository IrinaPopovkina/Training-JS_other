There are k workplaces in each office. What is the smallest number of offices sufficient to accommodate the number of employees?

Write a function named officeRooms that takes the numbers k (the number of seats in one office) and number (the number of office employees) as arguments 
and returns the smallest number of offices needed to accommodate the number of employees.

Examples:

officeRooms (300, 5000) should return 17;
officeRooms (250, 5150) should return 21.

Solution:

function officeRooms(k, number){
  return Math.ceil(number / k);
}
