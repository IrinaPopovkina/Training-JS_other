Write a function includesOtherMax that takes two numeric arrays arr1 and arr2 as arguments and returns true if arr1 contains the maximum element of arr2 and false otherwise.

Example:

includesOtherMax ([1, 7, 5], [3, 4, 5]) must return true because the first array contains 5 - the maximum element of the second array;
includesOtherMax ([9, 0, -5, 8], [1, 2, 3]) must return false since the first array does not contain 3 - the maximum element of the second array.

Solution:

function includesOtherMax(arr1, arr2){
  return arr1.includes(Math.max(...arr2));
}
