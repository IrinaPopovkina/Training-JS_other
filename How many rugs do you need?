You are given two positive integers a and b. 
a - corridor length, b - mat length. How many rugs (no overlap) are needed to cover the entire corridor?
Write a function called countOfRugs that takes the numbers a and b as arguments and returns the maximum number of rugs of length b needed to make a corridor of length a. 
Use the Math.floor () method.

Examples:

countOfRugs (5, 2) should return 2;
countOfRugs (30, 4) should return 7;
countOfRugs (3, 4) should return 0.

Solution:

function countOfRugs(a, b){
  return Math.floor(a / b);
}
