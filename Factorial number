You are given a positive integer n. Find the factorial of n (n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n)

Write a function called factorial that takes n as an argument and returns the factorial of n, i.e. product of numbers from 1 to n. Use a while loop when solving.

Examples:

factorial (2) must return 2;
factorial (3) must return 6;
factorial (8) must return 40320.

Solution:
function factorial(n){
let f = n;
 while (n > 1) {
  n = n - 1;
  f *= n;
 }
 return f;
}
