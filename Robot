We will teach the robot to speak. Let him round the exact values the way people do.
The exact value - a fractional number - is stored in the temperatureExact variable.

Get a line like "Outside the window is 32.3 degrees Celsius. That is almost 33"

Write a function called temperatureOutside that takes a positive integer temperatureExact (the exact temperature value) as an argument and returns a string as above.

Example:

almostOutside (35.6) should return "Outside the window is 35.6 degrees Celsius. That is 36";

Solution:

function temperatureOutside(temperatureExact) {
  return `Outside the window is ${temperatureExact} degrees Celsius. That is almost ${Math.ceil(temperatureExact)}`;
}
