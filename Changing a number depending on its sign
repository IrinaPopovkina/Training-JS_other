Write a function named changeNumber that takes the number num as an argument and doubles that number if it is positive or reverses the sign of that number if it is negative.

Example:

changeNumber (9) should return 18;
changeNumber (-7) should return 7;
changeNumber (0) should return 0.

Solution:

function changeNumber(num){
  return num < 0 ? -num : num * 2;
}
