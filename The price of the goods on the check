On the shop receipt the price of the goods and the name of the goods are printed in the form: "2.59 milk". 
Get the price of an item as a number.

Write a priceOfItem function that takes a receipt (purchase description as a string: "price item name") as an argument and returns a number - the price of the item.

Examples:

priceOfItem ("2.59 milk") should return 2.59.
priceOfItem ("4.55 bread") should return 4.55.
priceOfItem ("2 cake") should return 2.
priceOfItem (". 4 water") should return 0.4

Solution:

function priceOfItem(receipt){
  return parseFloat(receipt);
}
