Write a function called oppositeSum that takes three numbers a, b, c as arguments and returns the sum of these numbers with the opposite sign.

Example:

oppositeSum (1, 2, 3) should return -6;
oppositeSum (-1, -2, -3) should return 6;
oppositeSum (0, 1, -1) should return 0.

Solution:

function oppositeSum(a, b, c){
  return -(a + b + c);
}
