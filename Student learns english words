The student does not know a single English word at the beginning of the training. On the first day of class, he learned 5 English words. On each subsequent day, he learned 2 more words than on the previous one. How many days will the student know at least n English words?

Write a function called englishWords that takes a non-negative number n (n> = 0) (the number of English words the student wants to learn) as an argument and returns the number of days it takes to learn n words.

Examples:

function englishWords (5) should return 1; // a student  can learn 5 words in 1 day.
function englishWords (10) should return 2; // a student can learn 10 words in 2 days (5 + 7 = 12)
function englishWords (20) should return 3. // a student can learn 20 words in 3 days (5 + 7 + 9 = 21)
function englishWords (30) should return 4. // a student can learn 30 words in 4 days (5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 32)

Solution:
function englishWords(n){
 let days = 0;
 let words = 5;
   while (n > 0) {
     n = n - words;
     words = words + 2;
     days++;
   }
  return days;
}
