Given a number n> 0. Determine whether the given number n is prime.

A number is called prime if it is divisible only by 1 and by itself (that is, the number of divisors of the number is 2). For example, the numbers 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 are simple. The number 1 is neither simple nor compound.

Write a function called isPrime that takes a number n and returns true if the number is prime and false otherwise.

Examples:

isPrime (1) must return false;
isPrime (2) must return true;
isPrime (29) must return true;
isPrime (30) must return false.

Solution:

function isPrime(n){
let q = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
     if (n % i === 0) {
     q += (n / i) ** 0;
     }
  } 
  return q === 2;
}
