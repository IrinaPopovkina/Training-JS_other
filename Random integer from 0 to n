Math.random () returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (not inclusive).

Write a function named integerFrom0ToN that takes a positive integer n as an argument and returns a random integer between 0 and n inclusive.

Examples:

integerFrom0ToN (50) returns any integer from 0 to 50;
integerFrom0ToN (30) returns any integer from 0 to 30;
integerFrom0ToN (1000) returns any integer from 0 to 1000

Solution:

function integerFrom0ToN(n){
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * n);
}
