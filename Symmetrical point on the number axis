Points M and N are equally distant from point O but located on opposite sides of it in opposite directions.
Write a function called oppositePoint that takes the number x (the M-coordinate) as an argument and returns the N-coordinate as the string "N (x)".

Example:

oppositePoint (4)  must return "N (-4)";
oppositePoint (-4) must return "N (4)";
oppositePoint (0)  must return "N (0)".

Solution:

function oppositePoint(x){
  return `N(${-x})`;
}
