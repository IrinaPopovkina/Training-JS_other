Weight m is given in kilograms. Find the number of full tons in this weight. (1 t = 1000 kg).

Write a function named weightInTons that takes m (weight in kilograms) as an argument and returns the number of gross tons in that weight. Use the Math.floor () method.

Examples:

weightInTons (4163) should return 4;
weightInTons (23789) should return 23;
weightInTons (899) should return 0.


Solution:

function weightInTons(m){
  return Math.floor(m / 1000);
}
