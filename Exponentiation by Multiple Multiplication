Without using the exponentiation operation, raise the number a to the power n.
a^n = a * a * a * .... - n time;

Write a function named power that takes the numbers a and n as arguments and returns the value of a to the nth power (a and n are non-negative integers). Use a for loop in your solution. You cannot use the exponentiation operation and methods of the Math object in this exercise.

Examples:

power (3, 3) should return 27;
power (3, 0) should return 1;
power (0, 0) should return 1;
power (2, 5) should return 32.

Solution:

function power(a, n){
  let m = a;
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  else for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    m *= a;
  }
  return m;
}
