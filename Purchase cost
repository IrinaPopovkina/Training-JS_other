Paying at the checkout for the purchased goods, you received a receipt which contains the prices and the name of the goods in the form:

["18.7 salmon", "9.35 cheese", "2.99 milk", "9.99 chocolate bars"].

How much money should you pay for all purchases?

Write a function purchaseValue that takes a values array containing the prices and name of each item purchased as an argument and returns the total purchase price.

Examples:

purchaseValue (['1.31 bread', '7.96 cabbage', '2.10 candies', '0.84 salad']) should return 12.21.
purchaseValue (['1.50 onion') should return 1.5.

Solution:

function purchaseValue(values){
  let sum = 0;
  for(let el of values) {
    sum += parseFloat(el);
  }
  return sum;
}
