You are given two numbers a, b. Find the quotient of these numbers and round the result to the nearest whole number.
Write a function called quotient that takes two numbers a, b as arguments and returns the quotient of those numbers. 
Round the result to the nearest whole number.

Examples:

quotient (59, 27) should return 2;
quotient (50, 12) should return 4.

Solution:

function quotient(a, b){
  return Math.round(a / b);
}
