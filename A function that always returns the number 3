Write a function three that always returns 3. Quite easy? Yes if you don't take into account the conditions that you shouldn't use in the function:
• numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9;
• operation signs +, -, *, /,%
• length property

three () must return 3.

Solution:

function three(){
  let arr = [];
  return arr.indexOf(0) === 1 ? 3 : 3;
}
