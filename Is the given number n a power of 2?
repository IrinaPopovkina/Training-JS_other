Write a function called isPowerOfTwo that takes a non-negative number n as an argument and returns true if n is a power of 2 or false otherwise.
An indication of the solution. The Math.log2 (n) method returns the binary (base 2) logarithm of n.
Those. Math.log2 (n) is the power to which the number 2 must be raised to get the number n.
So if Math.log2 (n) is an integer then n is a power of 2.
The solution to the problem is to check if Math.log2 (n) is an integer.
You can check that the number x is an integer using the condition x% 1 === 0 (this condition is true for integers and false for non-integers).

Examples:

isPowerOfTwo (8) must return true; (since 8 is the third power of 2)
isPowerOfTwo (32) must return true; (since 32 is the fifth power of 2)
isPowerOfTwo (7) must return false (7 is not a power of 2).

Solution:

function isPowerOfTwo(n){
  return Math.log2(n) % 1 === 0;
}
