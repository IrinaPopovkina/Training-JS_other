When testing the user registration page, you need to test the "Phone number" field. 
You have a lot of tests to do and you decide to generate random phone numbers - 11-digit numbers. 
The phone number must start with a "+" character the first digit of the number must be 1.

Write a function called createPhoneNumber that returns a random phone number as a 12-length string starting with '+1' and random digits.

Indication.

Create a string containing the first two characters: '+1'.
Create a loop that runs 10 times.
In the body of the loop get a random number between 0 and 9 and add that number to the string.
Example:

createPhoneNumber () function returns the phone number as "+12345678910"

Solution:

function createPhoneNumber(){
  let str = '+1';
  for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    str += Math.trunc(Math.random() * 10);
  }
  return str;
}
