The values of the coefficients of the quadratic equation a, b, c are given. Find the roots of the equation or return the message "There are no roots".

a**2 * x + b * x + c = 0, a !== 0; a, b &c  are numbers.

Recall that to find the roots of a quadratic equation you need to find the discriminant by the formula:

D = b ** 2 - 4 * a *c;

If D <0 the equation has no roots. Otherwise the roots of the equation can be found by the formulas:

x1 = (-b + sqrt(D)) / 2*a, x2 = (-b - sqrt(D)) / 2*a

Write a function called quadraticEquation that takes the values of the variables a, b, c as arguments and returns the roots of the equation as an array [x1, x2]
or the message "There are no roots".

Examples:

quadraticEquation (1, 2, 1) should return [-1, -1];
quadraticEquation (5, 6, 1) should return [-0.2, -1];
quadraticEquation (1, 1, 1) should return "There are no roots".

Solution:

function quadraticEquation(a, b, c){
  let d = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c;
  let x1 = (-b + Math.sqrt(d)) / (2 * a);
  let x2 = (-b - Math.sqrt(d)) / (2 * a);
  return d < 0 ? "There are no roots" : [x1, x2];
}
